# PythonMobileFramework
This is my Python Mobile Automation Framework. I've only been coding a few months and have used GPT to help me learn along the way.

I use automation_elements to house the page elements

Combined_automation_methods is methods I use for both desktop and mobile

config.ini is where I store my configs

mobile_automation_methods is where I keep my methods

and test_quasar_mobile is my test suite
